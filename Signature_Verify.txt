Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu
  
  
 4. Set trust level
Enter '5' and then 'yes'.

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y
You should get the following output.

pub  rsa4096/D5A1D4F266DE8DDF      created: 2016-10-27  expires: never       usage: SC

gpg: assuming signed data in 'MullvadVPN-2019.4_x86_64.rpm'
gpg: Signature made Tue Jun 11 22:14:58 2019 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key CA83A46153BC58D69518ED49A26581F219C8314C
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: Good signature from "Mullvad (code signing) <admin@mullvad.net>" [ultimate]
